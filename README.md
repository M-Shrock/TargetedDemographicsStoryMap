Abstract:
The selection of retail locations are important business decisions with numerous implications. But is the common perception of specificly targeted consumers, aided by targeted demographic marketing, reflected with regard to site selection? Simply put, Whole Foods is seen as generally targeting wealthier, more educated individuals, do their store locations reflect this? Alternatively, Walmart has the stigma of aiming more towards the common consumer, if not those of less education and lower levels of wealth. Identifying three distinct companies, Sprouts, Whole Foods, and Walmart, this study will attempt to ascertain if their retail locations show a discrepancy with regard towards four demographic variables: Median Income, Post Graduate degree attainment, Median Net Worth, and Home Ownership.
